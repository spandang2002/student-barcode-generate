**Sample Database Input:**
Let's assume your MySQL database has a table named student with the following columns: id, name, and email.

Here is an SQL command to insert a sample student record into your database:

INSERT INTO student (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
This will create a student record with the following values:

id	name	email
1	John Doe	john.doe@example.com

**Sample Request**
Assuming the application is running on localhost at port 8080, you would make a GET request to the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/students/1/barcode
